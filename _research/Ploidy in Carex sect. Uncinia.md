<h2>Towards an integrative study of <i>Carex</i> sect. <i>Uncinia</i> in South America: completing a mosaic of diversification processes in the Chilean Andes</h2>

Carex sect. Uncinia (consisting of 74 species) constitutes a remarkable case of Carex radiation within Southern Hemisphere. It is distributed across South America and Oceania. The section has two differentiated centers of diversity, one in New Zealand (NZ, 45% of the section) and another in Andean South America (SA, 38% of the section). Chile is the most diverse South American country, with 71% of the American species. However, this statement is in need of reevaluation because data from SA may not be realistic due to the lack of comprehensive studies in the area. First, of the species belonging to sect. Uncinia, 94% of NZ representatives have been included in molecular phylogenetic studies, whilst we only have sequence information available for about 50% of the SA diversity. Second, the taxonomic knowledge of the section is scattered and incomplete, with no integrative taxonomic revision for the whole continent performed to date, and only a few local studies have been carried out until now. Such an imbalanced knowledge of the two diversity centers of sect. Uncinia seems to be due to the few collections available from SA, together with the complex morphology of the group.
Taxonomically complex groups are usually tackled using an array of approaches. Certainly, historically straightforward methods include histological studies such as those involving karyotype and genome size characterizations. New insights in the section for genome size, in combination with the chromosome numbers available up to date led us think that different ploidies may be occuring with implications in diversification. Based on that, it seems clear that it is urged to complete this “mosaic” of systematic, genomic and karyological knowledge for South American representatives. Given that Chile harbors most of the SA species of the section, a sampling effort focusing on this country seems the most reasonable start of this enterprise.
