<h2>Systematics of the genus <i>Carex</i> in Southeast Asia</h2>
<h4>Ayuda B3 - PPI2506 (PI: José Ignacio Márquez-Corro, 5,700€)</h4>

This project aims to establish a systematic study framework for the genus <i>Carex</i> in the tropics by sequencing lineages from Southeast Asia (SEA). In general, the data generated by this study will improve the available genomic information for <i>Carex</i> and will help resolve the existing systematic and taxonomic problems in Southeast Asia. To this end, DNA extraction and sequencing were proposed for approximately 85 species (out of the roughly 160 present in SEA).

The completion of this project will have a direct impact on the taxonomy and systematics of <i>Carex</i>, allowing for the necessary taxonomic and nomenclatural treatment of one of the three most diverse lineages of the genus, which has not yet been studied. It will establish a phylogenetic basis for future systematic, evolutionary, and biogeographical studies.
