<h2>Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao</h2>
<h4>Fieldwork associated with '<a href="https://jimarcor.github.io/research/">The Global Cyperaceae Database (GCypD)</a>' (PI: Pedro Jiménez-Mejías)</h4>

In this trip I aimed to visit some of the main herbaria in the Philippines (PNH, USTH, CAHUP, CMUH) and to collect Cyperaceae from this undercollected archipelago to enhance sedge knowledge.

**Day 1 (May 9^th^, 2024):** I started my trip with a flight from Sevilla (SVQ) to Vienna (VIE).

**Day 2 (May 10^th^, 2024):** After arriving in Vienna (VIE), I flew to Bangkok (BKK) and then continued on to Manila (MNL), arriving at 23:40.
