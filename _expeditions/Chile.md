<h2>From Coquimbo to Los Lagos</h2>
<h4>Fieldwork associated with the '<a href="https://jimarcor.github.io/research/2022%20IAPT%20Research%20Grant/">IAPT Research Grant 2022</a>' (PI: José Ignacio Márquez-Corro) and the 'Exploring plant evolutionary radiations. A comparative approach using the Gondwanan Disjunction America-New Zealand in Carex (DANZ)' project (PI: Pedro Jiménez-Mejías and Santiago Martín-Bravo)</h4>

This trip aimed to teach local students cytological techniques and to collect Cyperaceae species with special focus on <i>Carex</i> for genomic, morphological and chromosome characterization studies.

Day 1 (January 1st 2023): Departure from London.

Day 2 (January 2nd 2023): Arrival to Concepción, accomodation and planning with Paulo Muñoz.

Day 3 ([January 3rd 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/3)): Collecting <i>Carex</i> sect. <i>Uncinia</i> in Cerro Caracol near the Universidad de Concepción. [Preparation of roots](https://twitter.com/jimarcorr/status/1610743500328558592) for chromosome number counting, leaves for genome size estimation and drying the specimens.

Day 4 (January 4th 2023)): Incorporating field notes to the database and preparing the lab for the analysis. I had the chance to meet Glenda Fuentes Arce and Patricio López Sepúlveda, from the team of botanists at the university.

Day 5 (January 5th 2023): Root fixation. Purchase of materials for fielwork. Meeting with Carlos Baeza, karyological expert at UdeC.

Day 6 (January 6th 2023): Chromosome counting went wrong! Luckily, we have seeds from most of the species :) Finishing the preparation of the material for fieldwork.

Day 7 (January 7th 2023): Sorting out some minor logistic issues, and preparing everything to transport on Monday evening.

Day 8 (January 8th 2023): A bit of rest plus packing personal luggage.

Day 9 (January 9th 2023): Departure from Concepción to Santiago overnight.

Day 12 ([January 12th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/12)): An earthquake woke us up during the night! In the morning we went to [Parque Nacional Fray Jorge](https://twitter.com/S_Martin_Bravo/status/1614014917409140737), where we collected <i>Carex quinquin</i>, <i>C. setifolia</i> and other sedges in company of the park guide Juan Monardez Robles. We also visited the Universidad de La Serena herbarium (ULS), [where we met Prof. Gina Arancio](https://twitter.com/S_Martin_Bravo/status/1613503336241844225).

Day 13 ([January 13th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/13)): We went up the mountains to Mina El Indio, where we found <i>Carex vallis-pulchrae</i> and <i>C. gayana</i> among other andean species in the bofedal. Since we quickly gained altitude we were able to feel the puna (altitude sickness).

Day 14 ([January 14th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/14)): We headed to Tulahuen. We couldn't find any interesting species, but were able to gather some materials from [La Herradura recycling station](https://twitter.com/pjimmej/status/1614319025097682945) in Coquimbo.

Day 15 ([January 15th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/15)): We searched for <i>Carex catamarcensis</i>, unsuscessfully, around Torca river, close to Tulahuen. We drove to the next area, the Andes close to Santiago.

Day 16 ([January 16th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/16)): We went up to nearby areas around [Tres Puntos peak](https://twitter.com/pjimmej/status/1615028281039851525), in Farellones. We found seven <i>Carex</i> (!), two <i>Phylloscirpus</i> and one <i>Eleocharis</i>. Quite fructiferous :) I was able to finally see <i>C. macloviana</i> on the field, after [working](https://jimarcor.github.io/files/pdf/research/M%C3%A1rquez-Corro%20et%20al%202017%20AJB.pdf) with that plant during my MSc.

Day 17 ([January 17th 2023](https://www.inaturalist.org/calendar/jimarcor/2023/1/17)): We visited CONC herbarium in Concepción, completing the team, as María and Pablo joined us there. We checked all the Carex specimens, finding new vouchers for species like <i>C. catamarcensis</i>.
