I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Universidad Pablo de Olavide](https://www.upo.es/). I specialized in **evolutionary biology** (chromosome evolution) and the **systematics** of the family **Cyperaceae** (mainly focusing on ***Carex***), although I have also worked with bryophytes.

My work has been [published](publications) in journals such as *Journal of Systematics and Evolution*, *American Journal of Botany*, *Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society*, and *Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution*, among others. Overall, my [research](research) addresses the effect of a wide array of genomic, chromosomal, morphological and bioclimatic characters in clade-specific differences in diversification rates. Regarding [teaching](teaching) experience, I have lectured in Botany, Convervaction Biology and Ecological Restoration.
