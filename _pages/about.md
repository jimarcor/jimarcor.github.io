I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the
[Universidad Pablo de Olavide](https://www.upo.es/). I specialize
in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in
Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
