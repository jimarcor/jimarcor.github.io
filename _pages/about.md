I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Universidad Pablo de Olavide](https://www.upo.es/). I specialized in evolutionary biology and the systematics of the family Cyperaceae (mainly focusing on *Carex*).

My work has been [published](publications) in journals such as *Journal of Systematics and Evolution*, *American Journal of Botany*, *Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society*, and *Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution*, among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
